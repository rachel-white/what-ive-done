            <p class="about">What Ive Done is a new way of thinking about your daily productivity. Most productivity sites and apps progress through removing tasks you have done, but What I've Done works in the opposite direction. When you achieve something, you write it down. As you progress through your day and complete tasks (Acheivements), write it down. Congratulate yourself at the end of the day when you can see how much you have accomplished.

However you use What I've Done, it aims to be a new, happier, more positive approach to your daily productivity.
